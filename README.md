# Chat-Client-Server

Authors: joaquinarroyo and NachoCainelli

Implementation of a chat with the client server model in C

To compile the server program, use the 'make server' command, and the 'make client' command for the client program.

To use the server you'll have to run the program with a Port. For example "./servidor 5000"

To use the client you'll have to run the program with the local IP and the server Port. For example "./cliente 127.0.0.1 5000"
