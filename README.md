Implementation of a chat with the client server model in C

To compile the server program, use the next command
```
make server
```
and for the client use this other command
```
make client
```

To use the server you'll have to run the program with a Port. For example 
```
./servidor 5000
```

To use the client you'll have to run the program with the local IP and the server Port. For example 
```
./cliente 127.0.0.1 5000
```
